# Home Credit Dataset

### Introduction

The aim of this project is to use the Homecredit data to see what kind of models can be built for prediction, most importantly default risk prediction.
Final models are then deployed to Google Cloud Platform as APIs. API functionality is demonstrated using a Streamlit app.

### Technologies

- Typical data science tools - `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, but also `duckdb` for querying large pandas dataframes in memory.
- Gradient boosting frameworks - `XGBoost` and `LightGBM`.
- Clustering and dimensionality reduction - `hdbscan` and `umap`.
- Feature engineering and selection - `Featuretools`, `shap` and `Probatus`.
- Hyperparameter tuning - `scikit-optimize`.
- API creation and deployment - `Flask`, `Streamlit`, `Docker` and `Google Cloud Platform`.
